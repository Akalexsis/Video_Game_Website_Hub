## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while building the app were:
* Issues counting how many unfunded games there are
* * I thought the .reduce() function would work best, but I first thought I had to use it outside the finterUnfundedOnly() function.
  * I didn't know how to access the unfundedGamesArray array outside the function, so the .reduce() was called on the array within the function
* I faced issues implementing the ternary operator in challenge 6 as I was unsure how to save the strings to a variable
